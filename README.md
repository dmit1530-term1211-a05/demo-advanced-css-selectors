# [demo] Advanced CSS Selectors

A demo that shows how to use "Tree Structural Pseudo Classes" 

This demos covers: 
- :nth-child() selectors
  - select elements based on their positionas a child in any parent element.

- :nth-of-type() selectors
  - elect elements based on their position as a child as that type of selector.
  - The nth of type selector will work to select our paragraph, h2, etc. elements.
